# Circles – Active Circles Social Network

Circles is an experimental social network built around **Active Circles**: location‑based “intent bubbles” represented by AI agent personas.  
Users create Circles with objectives (free‑text intents), radii, and durations; when Circles collide in the real world, agents simulate scenarios, assess compatibility, and decide whether it is “worth it” to connect the people involved.

- On strong alignment (match), a chat is opened directly.
- On partial alignment (soft match), the non‑objective user is asked to opt in before a chat is created.
- Users never browse nearby people; discovery is fully agent‑driven.

For the full product and system design, see `DESIGN.md`.

## Project Status

This repository currently contains early design notes and scaffolding for future Python and TypeScript code.  
The target backend language is **Python 3.12**, and the frontend / tooling will use **TypeScript**.

Guidelines for AI coding agents working in this repo are defined in `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Repository Layout

Current structure (subject to change as implementation evolves):

- `AGENTS.md` – Rules and conventions for AI coding agents.
- `DESIGN.md` – High‑level product and system design for Active Circles.
- `src/` – Placeholder for future application code (Python / TypeScript).
- `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock` – Python project configuration.

## Getting Started (Development)

> Note: Implementation is still in progress. These steps describe the expected workflow as code is added.

1. **Python environment**
   - Ensure Python **3.12** is available (see `.python-version`).
   - Use your preferred environment manager (e.g. `uv`, `pyenv`, `venv`) to create an environment.

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   - Once dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml`, install them with:
     - `uv sync` (recommended) or another PEP 621–compatible tool.

3. **TypeScript / Node tooling (future)**
   - When a `package.json` exists, install dependencies with:
     - `npm install` or `pnpm install` depending on the chosen tool.

4. **Running tests**
   - When tests are added, follow the instructions in future docs (e.g. `pytest`, `npm test`).

## Contributing

- Follow the guidelines in `AGENTS.md` for coding style, testing, and dependency management.
- Keep changes small and focused, and document any nontrivial design decisions in `DESIGN.md` or a related design note.
